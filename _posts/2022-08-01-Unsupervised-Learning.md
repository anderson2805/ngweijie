[np.linalg.norm](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.norm.html) works as the Euclidean distance because it is the l2 norm, and the default value of the ord parameter in numpy.linalg.norm is 2.

norm_ij = np.linalg.norm(X[i] - centroids[j])  # Your code to calculate the norm between (X[i] - centroids[j])
